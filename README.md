ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Dog Breed Classification Using Transfer Learning
You built a deep learning model using TensorFlow 2.x and MobileNetV2 to classify 120 dog breeds using 10,000+ images from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification dataset. This is a multi-class image classification problem.

ðŸ§  Workflow Steps:
Data Preparation

Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and extracted it.

Loaded images and labels, and split into train/validation/test sets.

Applied image preprocessing and resizing.

Model Building

Used MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet) via tf.keras.applications.

Customized the top layers to suit the 120-class classification task.

Compiled with Adam optimizer and categorical_crossentropy loss.

Training

Used data augmentation to improve generalization.

Trained the model with early stopping and checkpoint callbacks.

Used TensorBoard for training visualization.

Evaluation

Evaluated performance on the validation and test sets.

Used metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Improvement

Started with a smaller subset of the data, scaled up to 10,000+ images.

Fine-tuned the base MobileNetV2 layers.

Saving & Export

Saved the final trained model in HDF5 or SavedModel format.

Demonstrated model prediction on custom dog images.
